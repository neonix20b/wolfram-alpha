# WolframAlpha
 
Wolfram|Alpha introduces a fundamentally new way to get knowledge and answers— not by searching the web, but by doing dynamic computations based on a vast collection of built-in data, algorithms, and methods.
 
## Installation
 
`gem "wolfram-alpha", github: "neonix20b/wolfram-alpha"`

And that's it!

## Usage

Creating a client instance:

	require 'wolfram-alpha'

	options = { "format" => "plaintext" } # see the reference appendix in the documentation.[1]

	client = WolframAlpha::Client.new "MY-API-ID", options

**External links:**

1. [WolframAlpha API: Documentation](http://products.wolframalpha.com/api/documentation.html)

Querying the engine:

	response = client.query "5 largest countries"

Handling responses:

	input = response["Input"] # Get the input interpretation pod.
	result = response.find { |pod| pod.title == "Result" } # Get the result pod.

	puts "#{input.subpods[0].plaintext} = #{result.subpods[0].plaintext}"

	# 5 largest countries | by total area = 1 | Russia | 1.708×10^7 km^2 |
	# 2 | Canada | 9.985×10^6 km^2 |
	# 3 | United States | 9.631×10^6 km^2 |
	# 4 | China | 9.597×10^6 km^2 |
	# 5 | Brazil | 8.515×10^6 km^2 |
	# (vertical ellipsis) |   |   |

Beware that `WolframAlpha::Response#[]` is finding a pod by its id, and not by its title.
